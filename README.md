# DS675-101-Milestone-4

NJIT Fall 2024: DS675-101 Machine Learning - Project Milestone 4

Pre-processing steps
- [ ] Feature transformations like one-hot-encoding, standard scaling of the relevant features (if applicable)
- [ ] Handling missing values (if applicable)
Exploratory Data Analysis
- [ ] Distribution plots of each feature
- [ ] Target variable distribution (if the problem is supervised classification problem)
- [ ] Correlation matrix of features 
- [ ] Correlation of features with the target variable
- [ ] Address the class-imbalance problem (if the target variable is imbalanced)
Development of the Machine Learning Model
- [ ] Build multiple ML models and compare them using hyperparameter tuning (Grid search or random search) using cross-validation
- [ ] Confusion matrix
- [ ] f1-score, AUC-ROC or R2 score (for regression)
- [ ] SHAP value of each feature
