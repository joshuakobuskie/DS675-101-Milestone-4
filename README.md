# DS675-101-Milestone-4

NJIT Fall 2024: DS675-101 Machine Learning - Project Milestone 4

## Pre-processing steps
- [x] Feature transformations like one-hot-encoding, standard scaling of the relevant features (if applicable)
- [x] Handling missing values (if applicable)
## Exploratory Data Analysis
- [x] Distribution plots of each feature
- [x] Target variable distribution (if the problem is supervised classification problem)
- [x] Correlation matrix of features 
- [X] Correlation of features with the target variable
- [ ] Address the class-imbalance problem (if the target variable is imbalanced)
## Development of the Machine Learning Model
- [ ] Build multiple ML models and compare them using hyperparameter tuning (Grid search or random search) using cross-validation
- [ ] Confusion matrix
- [ ] f1-score, AUC-ROC or R2 score (for regression)
- [ ] SHAP value of each feature
- [ ] Interpretation of the model (for simple models like Logistic Regression, interpretation of the final weights, for decision trees the plot of the trees, etc.)

## Deliverables
- [ ] A report on the ideas that were tried and the practical results obtained. The report should emphasize what differentiates our work from previous work on Kaggle
- [ ] A 20 minute video presenting the work. All members must participate in the video presentation
- [ ] The contributions and responsibility of each member must be stated in the report and presentation
- [ ] ipynb containing the experiments as a jupyter notebook. The ipynb file cannot contain different results than what is in the report.
